Hello, My name is Kelly Manheimer. My clans are Pumpkin, Coyote pass, Many goats, and Bitter Water, from the Hopi Reservation in Arizona. This is my first semester here at BYU-I; my major is still in a work in progress. My hobbies include reading, sleeping, playing music, and drawing. My favorite animal is giraffee, because I like their unique body structure and how they live their lives.
